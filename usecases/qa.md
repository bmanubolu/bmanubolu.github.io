# QA Ideas and Playbooks

Short, actionable experiments to try.

- Test prioritization: Rank tests by recent change surface, runtime, and failure probability.
- Flaky detection: Automate reruns and label flaky tests; add issue templates with collected logs.
- Visual regression: Use screenshot diffs + ML filters to ignore noise.
- Auto-issue generation: Convert failing logs into starter issues with reproduction steps and environment.
