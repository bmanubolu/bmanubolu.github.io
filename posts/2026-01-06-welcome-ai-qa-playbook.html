<p>TL;DR: This site collects reproducible examples, prompts, and small scripts that help teams apply AI to QA work.</p>

<p>Why this blog?</p>
<ul>
  <li>To document what works and what doesn’t when applying ML/LLMs to testing.</li>
  <li>To share short, reproducible playbooks that QA engineers can copy into CI and workflows.</li>
  <li>To provide a growing library of prompt templates and tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s next</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’ll publish short monthly playbooks: test-generation, flakiness triage, synthetic data patterns, and CI integrations.</li>
  <li>If you have a topic request (example: mutation testing with AI), open an issue or DM me on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
