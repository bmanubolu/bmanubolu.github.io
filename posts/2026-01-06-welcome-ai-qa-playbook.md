excerpt: "A personal blog focused on practical AI applications for software QA — playbooks, prompts, and experiments."

TL;DR: This site collects reproducible examples, prompts, and small scripts that help teams apply AI to QA work.

Why this blog?
- To document what works and what doesn't when applying ML/LLMs to testing.
- To share short, reproducible playbooks that QA engineers can copy into CI and workflows.
- To provide a growing library of prompt templates and tools.

What’s next
- I’ll publish short monthly playbooks: test-generation, flakiness triage, synthetic data patterns, and CI integrations.
- If you have a topic request (example: mutation testing with AI), open an issue or DM me on GitHub.
