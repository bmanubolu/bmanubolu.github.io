### Summary
- 14+ years in software quality engineering with a strong emphasis on test automation, CI/CD integration, and infrastructure for large-scale automated execution.
- My work centers on building reliable test frameworks, scalable execution infrastructure, reproducible playbooks, and automation-first pipelines that can be integrated into modern dev workflows.

### Technical focus
- Test automation frameworks: design and implementation using Selenium, WebdriverIO, Cypress, Playwright, TestCafe, and Rational Functional Tester.
- Visual testing & validation: Applitools and image-comparison strategies for UI regression detection.
- Languages & frameworks: Java and TypeScript for framework development; BDD (Cucumber, Jasmine), TestNG, and other test runners.
- API and integration testing: Postman collections, contract validation, and automated API checks integrated into pipelines.
- CI/CD & DevOps: Jenkins, Bamboo, GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild / CodePipeline — building pipelines that run tests as quality gates and generate actionable reports.
- Test execution infrastructure: containerized runners using AWS ECS, secrets management, and event-driven orchestration to reduce execution time and increase parallelism.
- Data & tooling: synthetic test-data generation patterns, schema-constrained record generation, and privacy-aware data synthesis.
- Flakiness detection & triage: automated rerun strategies, flakiness metrics, log aggregation, and triage playbooks to quickly identify and remediate flaky tests.
- Observability & metrics: test cycle time, flakiness rate, escape rate, and pass/fail trends used to prioritize automation effort and reduce feedback time.
- AI-assisted QA: prompt templates and small tooling to speed test-case generation, log triage, and test-data synthesis while maintaining reproducibility and auditability.

### Selected technical achievements
- Reduced manual testing effort by ~25% through modular automation frameworks and reusable test components.
- Cut test execution time by 50–65% by containerizing runners and optimizing parallel execution on AWS ECS.
- Implemented end-to-end CI/CD pipelines that automatically build, test, and gate releases using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and AWS CodePipeline.
- Built reproducible playbooks (prompts + scripts) for AI-assisted test-case generation and triage so teams can rapidly reproduce experiments and evaluate model outputs.
- Established actionable flakiness detection with automated reruns and prioritized fixes using telemetry and historical failure analysis.

### How I work (technical practices)
- Automation-first and pragmatic: focus on high-value automation and modular framework design to minimize brittle tests.
- Infrastructure-as-code for test runners: containerized, versioned execution environments to ensure reproducible results across CI and local runs.
- Data-conscious testing: generate constrained synthetic data and sanitize any real data used in experiments to meet privacy requirements.
- Metric-driven improvements: instrument tests and pipelines to gather meaningful metrics and use them to drive automation priorities.
- Reproducible artifacts: every playbook includes prompts, code snippets, and exact commands so others can copy and execute experiments reliably.
