<p>Short, actionable experiments to try.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test prioritization: Rank tests by recent change surface, runtime, and failure probability.</li>

  <li>Visual regression: Use screenshot diffs + ML filters to ignore noise.</li>
  <li>Auto-issue generation: Convert failing logs into starter issues with reproduction steps and environment.</li>
</ul>
